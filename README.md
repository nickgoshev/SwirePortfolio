# SwirePortfolio

## Business Problem

Swire Coca Cola's plants are only able to meet 94.4% of demand. Maintenance and mechanical failure result in downtimes that end up costing Swire $60 million a year through production losses.

## Project Objective

The goal of this analysis is to build predictive models to identify which machines are at risk of failure so as to mitigate downtime and optimize machine maintenance.

## Solution 

The solution was generating multiple predictive models and conducting unsupervised analyses such as clustering and association rule mining to identify patterns and make preparations for the most commonly worked on or at risk machines across Swire factories.

## Contributions

My contributions to this assignment include performing eda on null and missing values, as well as handling said values by examining features and reducing dimensionality to produce more precise models.

Outside of preprocessing data, I built an association rule mining model to identify relationships between maintenance plans, factories, and individual machines.

## Business Value of the solution

Taking preemptive measures to prevent unexpected maintenance and repairs can optimize downtime and mitigate risk of extensive stoppages. Using predictive models to identify machines at risk will allow for preparations to be made through methods such as preparing parts for machines that need maintenance often or repairing machines outside of the plant's operating hours.

## Difficulties

The biggest hurdle this group faced was preprocessing the data. The vast majority of unplanned maintenances had extreme amounts of null values so figuring out how to retain as much information as possible within the dataset proved to be difficult.

## What I Learned

I learned that sometimes you need to make concessions with data and sacrifice observations to be able to have higher quality data to input into models.
